# election_security_grants_analysis
R scripts to analyze election security grant funding from disclosures on the Election Assistance Commission website

This reposity contains two scripts. The first compiles several datasets on federal election security grants.  The code ingests some dataframes provided by EAC and scrapes others from the EAC website. The second script is a markdown file that compiles various graphs of the data compiled by the first script.
