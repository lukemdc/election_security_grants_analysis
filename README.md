# election_security_grants_analysis
R scripts to analyze election security grant funding from disclosures on the Election Assistance Commission website

This reposity contains two scripts. The first (eac_scraper) compiles several datasets on federal election security grants.  The code ingests some dataframes provided as CSVs by EAC and scrapes others from the EAC website. The second script (eac_markdown) is an R markdown that compiles various graphs of the data.  This markdown script appends various additional comparison datasets to the budget data generated by the first script.
